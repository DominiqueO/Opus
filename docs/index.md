# Opus Token: Technical Documentation

## Introduction
The Opus token is a solution to the tokenization of physical assets based on the ERC-1155 token standard. Compatibility and modularity both have high priority in the design of the Opus token. Therefore, the Opus token includes all mandatory functions of the ERC-1155 standard to achieve full compatibility with the ERC-1155 ecosystem and security through maturity.
