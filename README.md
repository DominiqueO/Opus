# Opus

This project is a proof-of-concept within the Blockchain Challenge 2021 hosted by the Center for Innovative Finance from the University of Basel. The case was developed in collaboration with BearingPoing and the goal was to find a solution around tokenisation of physical assets. 

Our team decided to focus on real-world art & antiques. We use the ERC1155 implementation for tokenisation and fractionalisation and try to extend the standard with desired functionalities.

This repo only includes the technical documentation and smart contract prototypes. Other functionality and an in depth documentation may follow at a later stage.
